# Statistical Methods for the Analysis of EHR data

## Overview (Winter 2022)

This course aims to provide an introduction to the challenges and benefits of working with data from electronic health records (EHRs).  As a starting point, we will consider the fundamental problem of phenotyping and the associated statisical challenges.  We will then go through the basics of positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and run simulation studies for a new method I have developed for high-dimensional regression in the PU setting (SAPUL).

## Overview

In weeks 1-6, articles will be assigned and written reflection is required.  Guidance on how to read and respond to an academic paper can be found [here](https://github.com/jlgrons/EHR_Reading_Course/tree/main/Article%20Reviews).

In weeks 7-13, you will be responsible for understanding a new method for high-dimensional regression in the PU setting and running simulation studies to better understand its performance.  You will be given code to implement the method which can be found [here](https://github.com/jlgrons/EHR_Reading_Course/tree/main/SAPUL).
